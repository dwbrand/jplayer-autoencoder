jplayer-autoencoder
===================

Upload and autoencoding script for jPlayer


This is a work in progress.  The goal of this is to allow a user to upload an audio file to a website,
and have it auto-process into the appropriate files types for HTML audio automatically.  The files here
can be used to form the shell of an upload process, but will require both configuration and customization
in order to work correctly.

All files are supplied as-is, and getting everything to work properly is left as an exercise to the developer.


Requirements
------------

* PHP
* jQuery 1.8.2 or newer
* jQueryUI 1.8.4 or newer
* Bash shell
* ffmpeg (compiled with libvorbis support)
